					<h3><b>Content­-based Storage Mode in Btrfs​</b> (<a href="https://github.com/quadcores/linux">code</a>)</h3>
				  	
				  	<p class="subtext"><i>(With Nitesh Singh, Rohan Kadekodi, Vedang Joshi; Mentored by <a href="http://harshadjs.github.io/">Harshad Shirwadkar</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/saurabhkadekodi?trk=pub-pbmap">Saurabh Kadekodi</a>; Ongoing)</i></p><br>  	

				  	<p>
				  		The project implements content­-based storage mode for the Btrfs file system. This project is also mentioned in the TODO­ list of the Btrfs ideas page.<br><br>
				  	
				  		In content­-based storage mode, the data is stored on the disk only on the basis of hash ​of its content. A new b­tree named hash_inode tree is added to the tree of tree roots in the existing Btrfs source code. The hash (SHA­256) of the file is first calculated internally. A (key, value) pair of this hash (as key) and the inode number of the file stored on disk (as value) is then added to the hash_inode_tree. This brings in inherent deduplication at file level ­ as Btrfs must index the inodes by 256­-bit hash values of the entire data they hold respectively, thus eliminating storing redundant objects again. The lookup is also hash based, thus extremely quick.<br><br>
				  	
				  		Developed with the use case of content cache routers and CMU’s ​XIA in mind. Also, other use cases like Amazon S3, 	Lustre and other systems using REST API.<br><br>

					<h3><b>REST library for Content-Based Storage Mode in Btrfs</b> (<a href="https://github.com/quadcores/rest_lib">code</a>)</h3>
				  	
				  	<p class="subtext"><i>(With Nitesh Singh, Rohan Kadekodi, Vedang Joshi; Ongoing)</i></p><br>  	

				  	<p>
				  		Developed a library that interfaces the REST API calls to the Content-based storage mode in Btrfs. <br>
				  	
				  		Any REST API using system can easily store and retrieve data based on its content using this library in Btrfs. Based in python. Content-based storage mode must be enabled.<br><br>

					<h3><b>Benchmarking tool for Content-based filesystems</b> (<a href="https://github.com/quadcores/cbsbench">code</a>)</h3>
				  	
				  	<p class="subtext"><i>(With Nitesh Singh, Rohan Kadekodi, Vedang Joshi; Ongoing)</i></p><br>  	

				  	<p>
				  		This tool assists in testing the I/O performance of filesystems working on the principle of Content-based Storage. Currently supports for filesystems which store and retrieve files using SHA-256 hashes of the content. <br><br>

				  	<p class="subtext"><i>(With Nishad Dawkhar; Aug 2014 – Oct 2014)</i></p> <br/>

				  	<p>
						Designed and developed a Java, MongoDB based software with an intuitive GUI that aims to facilitate easy data storage and analysis of University results. It used regular expressions to map different types of fields intelligently and parsed through the complete document with thousands of entries to populate the database. Comprehensive analysis of the results was also made available. This software served the Engineering Institutes across my University to process and analyze large-scale data of Exam Results, originally released only in PDF format.<br><br>

				  	<p class="subtext"><i>(Aug 2014 – Sept 2014)</i></p><br/>

				  	<p>
						Designed and built a web application for flight booking of multiple service providers through a common platform. This application was built using the LAMP stack. In addition, developed a suggester module based on a graph-based traversal of the connected airports to help generate meaningful suggestions based on connected entities.<br><br>

					<h3><b>Generic Form Generator</b></h3>
				  	
				  	<p class="subtext"><i>(Winter Internship, Nov 2014 – Dec 2014)</i></p><br>	

				  	<p>
				  		Developed a generic form generator (similar to Google forms) where it would be possible to create customizable comprehensive forms as per user's requirement. This project was developed in Python, Django Framework, jQuery and MongoDB for the database.<br><br>

					<h3><b>ZFS, NFS, SMB Docker Volume Plugins</b></h3>
				  	
				  	<p class="subtext"><i>(Internship, Jul 2016 – Aug 2016)</i></p><br>	

				  	<p>
				  		Developed Docker volume plugin for:
							1. ZFS partitions on the host machine.
							2. SMB shares and NFS shares on the host machine. 

						Allows the docker containers to mount the ZFS Pools/SMB shares/NFS shares as volumes on the host system. The user can create any number of volumes with names of own choice and also decide about where to mount these volumes on the ZFS Pool/SMB share/NFS share.

						Also a part are auto-configuration scripts for ZFS, SMB, NFS and testing modules.<br><br>

<h3><b>Current</b></h3><br>
I am a graduate student at <a href="http://www.cs.ucla.edu/">UCLA CS Department</a> where I am pursuing my MS in CS. I completed my undergraduate study at <a href="http://pict.edu/">Pune Institute Of Computer Technology</a> (affiliated to Savitribai Phule Pune University). I am deeply interested in the Systems domain, especially file and storage systems. Algorithms and structures that govern the security of data and the behavior of blocks on disk attract me. I also have a liking for Databases, Operating Systems, Computer Networking and System Programming. I have had adequate exposure in these fields by the virtue of my undergraduate coursework and projects.<br><br>

<h3><b>What next?</b></h3><br>
My ultimate professional ambition is to pursue a highly rewarding research career, either as a teaching faculty member, or at an advanced R&D position in the industry.<br><br>

<hr/>
<h3><b>On a personal note</b></h3><br>
My non-academic interests include photography, singing, sound mixing, participating in elocution and debate competitions, coding competitions, etc. I have strong inter-personal skills and leadership skills. I am pro-active in inter-college theater competitions and other cultural activities.<br><br>

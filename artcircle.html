	  		<br>Art Circle is PICT's cultural group which consists of Music, Acting, Dance, Sets and Crafts, Lights, Fine Arts and lots more. To express as I see it, it is a family away from family. A group of around 80-100 artists and theater enthusiasts who love to learn and bring out their creativity in all the ways possible.<br><br>
	  	
	  		Art Circle organizes and performs in all the cultural events of the institution. The main aim though is to represent the institute in 2 major inter-collegiate drama competitions - the prestigious Purushottam Karandak and the ever dashing Firodia Karandak. These competitions are known to be the breeding grounds for artists and need skillful blending of acting, music, dance, sets and lights to create an impact.<br><br>

	  		I joined Art Circle when I was a sophomore, as a singer. That was when I started exploring art in the real sense. With time increased my capacity and voracity to fondly manage academics and Art Circle simultaneously, as both gave me what I wanted - joy. Toady, I find myself extremely lucky to be leading this group.<br><br> 

	  		This year was historic and way too special for all of us. We won the 51st Purushottam Karandak. Yes, we won the distinguished Purushottam Karandak! Along with it, we won many other prizes. That's not all! We further went on to win the 2nd prize in Purushottam Mahakarandak (state-level drama competition where winners from each division compete). Here are a few pics of the team and the prizes:<br><br>
